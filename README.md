# AI Internship Finder

> Reality-driven AI internship matching system for practical career growth.

## 🚀 Problem

Students repeatedly apply to internships they are not realistically eligible for due to:
- Inflated job descriptions
- Keyword-based job portals
- Lack of skill gap visibility
- No structured improvement roadmap

This leads to rejection cycles and wasted effort.

---

## 💡 Solution

AI Internship Finder uses explainable AI to:

- Extract and normalize resume skills
- Detect inflated internship job descriptions
- Calculate a Skill Readiness Score (0–100)
- Filter only realistically achievable internships (≥60% readiness)
- Highlight skill gaps
- Generate a personalized 30-day improvement roadmap
